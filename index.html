<p> I'm a Digital Humanities Major currently in my third year at Illinois
    Istitute of Technology in Chicago. Although I'm fascinated by the digital
    world and web design, my passion has always been writing.

<p> Basketball as well as CrossFit and running. I have won many tournaments,
    city final games, and I have ran in quite a few races, but I am most proud of
    the full marathon I completed in spring 2014. One day I would like to run the
    North Pole Marathon.
</p>
    
<p> My ambitions aren't quite set in stone just yet. I'm focusing on exploring
    all avenues and choosing a career path that allows me to be creative,
    to continue to learn and grow, and be happy.
