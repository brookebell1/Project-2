  <p> I've been playing elite basketball for many years. During High School, I played for the Paul Kane Blues and won the City Championship, had an appearance at Provincials and won many tournaments. Upon transferring to Ross Sheppard High School, I was nomimated and played in the Provincial Shooting Stars All-Star Game. Before playing for Illinois Tech, I played for two years at Morton College. There I earned an Exemplary Academic award for my grades. During my time spent at Morton, I was also on the cross country team where I fell two spots short of qualifying for Nationals. I have also ran a marathon back in spring 2013 and I also do CrossFit.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p> My goal is to play basketball at the professional level around the globe. I want to play the best and use basketball as a vehicle to learn about new cultures. I would also like to become an elite level coach and work with athletes to help bring their game up to peak performance.
